Expense Reimbursement  

The Company will reimburse employees for reasonable and necessary expenses incurred in the course of Company business.  Reasonable expenses incurred by employees in the performance of their duties generally include transportation, travel expenses, business meals and entertainment.  The following guidelines should be followed:  

Reimbursable Expenses:	
Travel Expenses
	Domestic Airfare	All flights should be booked at the lowest coach fare available. First-class tickets are not reimbursable; furthermore, any upgrades to first class are at your expense.  
	International Airfare	Business class is permitted only for international travel of at least eight (8) hours of continuous published air travel (not including time spent on layovers).

For international travel under eight hours; coach class airfare should be booked.
	Unused, Non-Refundable and/or Lost Tickets	If possible, refund unused tickets as soon as possible.  If the ticket is non-refundable, the amount will be applied to future corporate trips. 

If necessary, Freight Services will refund charges due to changes in flights and schedules. Please contact your Manager with regard to flight adjustments.

Lost airline tickets will not be reimbursed. Upon alerting Freight Services, a replacement ticket will be issued for a fee.  If the Company is unable to issue a new ticket, you are responsible for filling out and submitting a lost ticket application.
	Miscellaneous 	Reasonable phone charges will be reimbursed while you are away from home.  You should use calling cards or cellular phones instead of hotel room calls.  While traveling internationally, use calling cards. 

Reasonable hotel gym charges will be reimbursed.  Charges should not exceed $15 per day. 
Meals 		Only actual expenditures will be reimbursed; therefore, receipts are needed for every meal, regardless of its cost. In the case that a receipt is not available, maximum reimbursement for meals is as follows:

      Breakfast - $10         Lunch - $15         Dinner - $25

You should use the amounts listed above as guidelines for meals while traveling. Freight Services understands that while in major metropolitan areas (i.e., New York City and Chicago) the cost may be higher.

Entertainment		Business-related entertainment expenses are allowed. Business-related entertainment expenses are costs that are incurred as a direct result of Company business and include activities such as potential client meals and/or entertainment where business discussions occurred.  Expenses for the sole purpose of your entertainment will not be reimbursed.
Car Rental	Car Size	Generally, compact-size cars should be rented, unless a medical reason requires that you rent a larger vehicle. If two or more employees are traveling together, a mid-size car may be rented. 
	Insurance	In the United States and Canada, employees must purchase the loss damage waiver, personal effects protection and personal accident insurance coverage that is offered by the rental company.  If you have questions about the appropriate amount of coverage, please contact the Company before purchasing the insurance. Freight Services is also insured through American Express (coverage limited to cars with a current value of $50,000 or less).

International travel should be arranged prior to departure. Please contact your Manager for further instructions. 
Other Transportation	Mileage Reimbursement	You will be reimbursed at the current IRS rate for mileage over the “base” mileage while conducting company business.  Base mileage is the round trip mileage between work and home.  Normal commuting time and miles are not eligible for reimbursement. 
	Parking, Taxi, Tolls & Ground Transportation	Parking, bridge, tunnel, and road tolls will be reimbursed when traveling for business purposes.  You should submit receipts for all such expenses with your reimbursement request.

When traveling for thirty-six (36) hours or more, you should park in the airport’s long-term parking lot or offsite lots.

Reasonable use of shuttles, taxis, etc. will be reimbursed. Please contact your Manager before booking limos and town cars, if there are no other options.
Miscellaneous Travel	Laundry	Laundry, dry cleaning, and pressing will be reimbursed only if the business trip exceeds seven (7) full days. 
	Gratuities	Reasonable gratuities for services such as meals, hotel shuttles, etc. will be reimbursed. 
Cancellations		It is your responsibility to notify any applicable party of any cancellation (e.g., hotel, car rental, airfare) prior to the time of cancellation to avoid “no-show” charges. 

Freight Services will not reimburse “no-show” charges, unless they were unavoidable. 

Non-Reimbursable Expenses

The following is a non-inclusive list of expenses that are not eligible for reimbursement:

•	Air phone charges, except for emergency use.  The employee must submit a written explanation of the reason for use.
•	Annual fees and any interest or late fees on credit cards.
•	Personal sundries such as reading materials, medication, batteries, toiletries, etc.
•	Personal grooming services such as haircuts and manicures.
•	Personal entertainment such as movies, videos, airline headphones, and other expenses which cannot be defined as a business entertainment.
•	Club dues for airline club rooms (i.e., Red Carpet Club).
•	Travel accident insurance, unless covered under a car rental insurance policy.
•	Fines for traffic or parking violations.
•	Theft of personal property, including articles stolen from either personal or rental cars, unless covered under a car rental insurance policy.

All business expenses must be approved in writing by the Vice President of Operations.  Employees with reimbursable expenses must submit approved expense reports, along with dated receipts, to the Vice President of Operations at the end of the month in which the expenses were incurred.  Only the Vice President of Operations can authorize exceptions to this policy.  Expense forms may be obtained from your Manager. 

We strive to distribute reimbursement checks in a timely manner after submission of an approved expense report.  Expense policies are set in accordance with applicable law, and, accordingly, expense reimbursements are not considered compensation in any way.
