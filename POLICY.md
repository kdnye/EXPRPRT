# Expense Reimbursement Policy

The Company reimburses employees for reasonable and necessary expenses incurred while conducting business on the Company's behalf. These guidelines are enforced programmatically in [`backend/src/domain/policy.rs`](backend/src/domain/policy.rs) and [`backend/src/services/expenses.rs`](backend/src/services/expenses.rs), with UI guardrails in the expense submission flows under [`frontend/src/routes`](frontend/src/routes).

## Reimbursable Expenses

### Travel

#### Domestic Airfare

- Book the lowest available coach fare.
- First-class tickets and voluntary upgrades are not reimbursable.

#### International Airfare

- Business class is permitted only when a single continuous published flight segment exceeds eight (8) hours (layovers excluded).
- For shorter itineraries, book coach class.

#### Unused, Non-Refundable, or Lost Tickets

- Request refunds for unused tickets immediately; apply non-refundable balances to future trips.
- Freight Services will assist with change fees when schedule adjustments are requiredâ€”coordinate with your Manager.
- Lost airline tickets are not reimbursed. Contact Freight Services for replacement tickets and, if necessary, submit a lost ticket application.

#### Miscellaneous Travel Charges

- Reasonable phone charges are reimbursable. Prefer calling cards or mobile phones to hotel room lines; use calling cards internationally.
- Hotel gym fees up to **$15 per day** are reimbursable.

### Meals

- Submit itemized receipts for every meal, regardless of cost.
- When a receipt is unavailable, reimbursement is limited to the following per diem amounts:

| Meal      | Maximum Reimbursement |
|-----------|-----------------------|
| Breakfast | $10                   |
| Lunch     | $15                   |
| Dinner    | $25                   |

- Use the amounts above as planning guidelines. Higher costs may be approved for major metropolitan areas (e.g., New York City, Chicago).

### Entertainment

- Business-related entertainment is reimbursable when it directly supports Company business (e.g., client meals with documented discussions).
- Personal entertainment is not reimbursable.

### Car Rentals

- **Vehicle size:** Rent compact cars unless medical needs require a larger vehicle; two or more employees traveling together may rent a mid-size vehicle.
- **Insurance:** In the United States and Canada, purchase the rental company's loss damage waiver, personal effects protection, and personal accident coverage. Freight Services also maintains American Express coverage (for vehicles valued at $50,000 or less). Consult the Company if unsure about required coverage.
- Arrange international rentals prior to departure in consultation with your Manager.

### Other Transportation

- **Mileage reimbursement:** Claim the IRS mileage rate for business mileage exceeding your normal round-trip commute. Commuting time and miles are not reimbursable.
- **Parking, tolls, and ground transport:** Submit receipts for parking, bridge, tunnel, and road tolls. Use shuttles and taxis when practical; obtain Manager approval before booking limousines or town cars.
- **Long-term travel:** For trips lasting thirty-six (36) hours or more, use airport long-term or off-site parking.

### Miscellaneous Travel

- **Laundry:** Laundry, dry cleaning, and pressing are reimbursable when the trip exceeds seven (7) full days.
- **Gratuities:** Reasonable tips for travel-related services (e.g., meals, shuttles) are reimbursable.

### Cancellations

- Notify hotels, rental agencies, airlines, and other vendors of cancellations before the cutoff to avoid no-show fees.
- No-show fees are not reimbursable unless the charges were genuinely unavoidable.

## Non-Reimbursable Expenses

The following non-inclusive list of expenses is never reimbursed:

- Airphone charges except in emergencies, with written justification.
- Annual fees, interest, or late charges on personal credit cards.
- Personal sundries (reading materials, medication, batteries, toiletries, etc.).
- Personal grooming (haircuts, manicures, similar services).
- Personal entertainment (movies, videos, airline headphones, and similar non-business items).
- Airline club dues (e.g., Red Carpet Club).
- Travel accident insurance unless bundled with required rental car coverage.
- Traffic or parking violation fines.
- Theft of personal property, including items stolen from personal or rental vehicles, unless covered by rental insurance.

## Approvals and Reimbursement Process

- Submit approved expense reports with dated receipts to the Vice President of Operations at month-end for the period in which expenses were incurred.
- Only the Vice President of Operations may authorize policy exceptions.
- Expense report forms are available from your Manager.
- Reimbursement checks are issued promptly after approval. Expense reimbursements comply with applicable law and are not treated as compensation.
